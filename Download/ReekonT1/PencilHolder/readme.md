-----------

The Reekon T1 tape measure showed a pencil holder on their Kickstarter, but it never shipped with the tape measure and it is not available to purchase, so I made one myself.

USE PETG WHEN PRINTING FOR FLEXIBILITY!!

I made a couple different versions.
T1 Pencil Clamp spring - this uses the built in screw on the front of the T1.  Unscrew and re-use on this clamp.  I think this clamp looks the best.  Also, even when you don't have a pencil in the mount, it stays in place.

T1 Pencil Clamp C - this uses an additional M3 18mm screw.  There is a threaded hole in the T1 that this screws into right next to the philips screw from the clamp above.  This work well but it spins around if you don't have a pencil in the mount.

100% infill - 2 perimeters - 2.0 layer height
