# INTRO
The contents of this folder contain paid files for 3D printing. In order to respect the authors wishes, and protect myself from legal action, I will be putting each project in their own password protected zip. 

# How to Create Password Protected Zip:
```bash
zip -er new_zip_file.zip folder_to_compress
```

# How to Extract Password Protected Zip:
```bash
unzip new_zip_file.zip
```
